### This project is a Contact Management System, and it was developed during my Software Test, Automation, and Quality Assurance course. It uses object-oriented programming principles and design patterns to create a technically sound and reliable application. 

### It contains functionalities such as storing updating and deleting contact information.  The functionalities are validated by comprehensive JUnit tests. These tests covered boundary conditions, error scenarios, and positive test cases to ensure the application works the way it is intended under different conditions.
